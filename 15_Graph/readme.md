# graph
- undirected - a grapgh where edges has no orientation. (u,v)edge are identical to (v,u)edge
- directed(digraph) - edges has direction.

## edges
- weighted - edges has weight (u,v,w).
- unweight - edges dont have a weight (u,v) will do the naming

## Special Graphs:
### Trees:
    Undirected graphs + trees.
### Rooted Trees:
    Directed graph + trees + dirctional edges(all in one direction...either towards node or away from it)
